1. Project description: Draughts is played on an 8x8 chessboard. There are 2 players in the game, each side takes 12 pieces of one color and place one on each of the black squares in the first 3 rows of your side. The winning condition of the game is when any one of the 12 pieces has reached the other side of the board. Our program is intended to generate all possible movement of a draught game by using a tree class similar to the sample code. 

2. Create a class for your game/problemâ€™s board state 

3. Create a tree class for your class, storing each state of the game in a tree node. 

4. A function for BFS and DFS.

5. Three search algorithm or decision-making algorithm.
